For example, I arranged the individual timetables for each student so that they could keep track of their tasks for the day. I helped conduct activities like colour differentiation, movement exercises for psycho motor skills, and visits to public places to train social interaction skills. I learnt how children on the autistic spectrum have difficulty doing routine tasks and interactions, and that as a society we can do better at accepting those different from us. </p> </td> <td>
